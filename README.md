# PRODIGY_ML_03
Cats vs Dogs Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Welcome to Prodigy-ML-03, a project implemented in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that classifies images of cats and dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is trained on the popular Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle, and uses OpenCV for image preprocessing and scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.


# üìå Libraries used:

numpy : Numerical operations  
opencv-python: Image reading and preprocessing  
matplotlib.pyplot : Visualization of predictions  
scikit-learn : Model training and evaluation  
joblib : Saving/loading trained model  


# üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

Source:
Structure: Images named like cat0.jpg, dog1.jpg, etc.
All images are converted to grayscale and resized to 64√ó64 pixels.


## üß† Features

Data preprocessing (grayscale conversion, resizing, flattening)

Label extraction from filenames

Training an SVM classifier (with linear kernel)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of predictions
